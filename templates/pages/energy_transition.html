	<h1>Energy Transition</h1>
	<p>The world population is growing and wealth in certain countries is increasing. As conventional energy resources are becoming scarce and energy demand is growing, the need to switch to more efficient use of resources and more radical changes to use sustainable energy resources is becoming more and more urgent. Additionally, greenhouse gas emissions need to go down substantially over the next 35 years.</p>

	<p>This university emphasizes its part in this transition through the Strategic Area Energy (SAE), which has been one of the three focus areas for several years now.</p>

	<p> At the SAE we explore a broad spectrum of promising technologies. In the short term, research focuses on the built environment, new fuel technologies and smart grid solutions. Further away, research will deliver novel solar cells and other new revolutionary energy conversion and storage technologies. In the longer run, our nuclear fusion research will contribute to a sustainable transition in a global team effort.</p>

	<p>Examples of research questions of previous Energy Transition Track Projects:
		<ul style="list-style-type: square">
			<li>Can heat pump systems become important contributors to fulfilling the heat demand in the Netherlands?</li>
			<li>How can the production process of wood vinegar, a replacement for use of chemical pesticides in rural Thailand, be optimized?</li>
			<li>Can we run a bus on formic acid?</li>
			<li>Can the heat released when burning metals, make an important contribution to either electricity demand or energy demand in transport (mobility)?</li>
			<li>How can we design a smart grid for the TU/e campus?</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Teams in the track </h3>
	<p> Energy transition is a broad topic. Therefore, the track is split in six different teams. Each team with their own goals and each lifting energy to a whole new level.</p>

		<p>Team SOLID is a student team at Eindhoven University of Technology, working on a new concept called “metal fuels”, in which metals are used to sustainably store energy. When metal powders are burned, heat is released and the metals turn into metal oxides, also known as rust. The heat can be used to warm houses, drive trains and sail ships. The metal oxides formed during the combustion are captured. Later, these can be reduced back to metal powder, by using green energy. This way, a sustainable cycle is made in which energy is stored.

		<p>While policymakers from nations around the world make big promises about reducing emissions and stopping climate change, the construction market is slow to adapt. If our society is to stop climate change in this generation, then changes must come fast. Designing homes with comfort and health in mind ensures that people will want to live in them. In addition, the homes should provide a healthy indoor climate and promote a healthy lifestyle.

		</a>
		<p>Team FAST wants to generate public awareness about our technology and support the transition to a new energy system, wherein our technology can be applied on a large scale. To realize this awareness, TeamFAST builds a system that shows one of the many possibilities for our system. Climate change is currently one of the biggest issues of our society. The exhaust of greenhouse gasses, such as CO2 and NOx's, are one of the main contributors to climate change the enhanced greenhouse effect . Our innovation is a smart solution which helps to reduce these exhausts and thus helps battle climate change.

		<p>The world needs to become more sustainable if we want to keep it habitable. We are investing in renewable energy sources and more and more cars are driving on alternative fuels. An increasing amount of researchers are warning about the global warning. Humanity needs to get earth balanced again, and every bit helps. In some parts of the world synthetic pesticides are used in agriculture without proper regulation or control. This leads to unbalanced ecological systems, which harm the local environment. Wood vinegar is a biological alternative for the synthetic chemicals, with the possibility of being produced from leftover wood of the farm.
