	<p>In this track you will focus on applications of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) and ground robots requiring the integration and development of cutting edge technology and algorithms. Each of these applications requires state-of-the-art technology (e.g., computation, 3D printing, sensing), the application of scientific knowledge of several domains (e.g., robotics, artificial intelligence, motion control, communication systems, computer vision), and an innovative continuous process of improving current and developing new solutions. You are challenged to contribute to this process, right here, right now, in the city of high-tech systems.</p>

		<p>Currently, the team is divided into four functional groups to tackle different challenges in regard to the drone show.  Together with the partner, Alvular, the team is expecting to make an immediate transition and provide a visually appealing drone show here at Eindhoven University of Technology in 2017. The teamâ€™s efforts are not limited to a show at the Eindhoven University of Technology, of course. After successfully organizing and performing light shows with drones in Eindhoven, the team has the ambition to go further by organizing shows for other events as well, possibly adding more drones, effects and lights. Companies such as Intel have already proven that large groups of drones can be orchestrated such that they deliver an awesome show. Firefly hopes to accomplish something similar in the future!</p>
