	<h3>Student competition on biosensors for health</h3>
		<p>The mission of SensUs is to stimulate the development of biosensors in a friendly but competitive manner, whereby students make and design innovative biosensors. Each year, a societally impactful indicator of health is chosen as an objective in collaboration with different stakeholders. 
	
		<br /><br /> An important aim in healthcare is to keep people healthy as long as possible and to enable people in need of care to live a high-quality life in their own environments. Healthcare is developing toward a world wherein care is delivered in a highly personalized manner, attuned to the status of the patient, based on actual, precise and reliable data.
	
		<br /><br />SensUs stimulates information sharing and community development for continuous innovation in biosensors. It forms a platform for open innovation and welcomes stakeholders such as healthcare organizations, patient organizations, R&D funding organizations, and companies to give input for the competition (e.g. regarding the technical goals of the competition) or otherwise support the competition.</p>
